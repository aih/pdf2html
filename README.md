[jQuery-File-Upload](http://aquantum-demo.appspot.com/file-upload) is developed by Sebastian Tschan, with the source available on [github](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload). Example code is [ported to Django](https://github.com/sigurdga/django-jquery-file-upload) by Sigurd Gartmann ([sigurdga on github](https://github.com/sigurdga/)).

Introduction
============

This is a small example on how to setup Sebastian Tschan's jQuery File Upload in Django. He has a working demo on his [webpage](http://aquantum-demo.appspot.com/file-upload) and a [github repository](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload) with an example on how to do it in PHP.

Here, you'll find a minimal Django project with a minimal app. You can run the example standalone by cloning the repository, running the migrations and starting the server.

I want to give a thank to Sebastian Tschan, the original author, and Jørgen Bergquist for helping me over the first hurdles.
