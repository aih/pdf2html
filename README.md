Terrific library for pdf to html conversion : pdf2htmlEX[https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Quick-Start], using ttfautohint as --external-hint-tool=ttfautohint

Conversion to Word can use pandoc

A web-based converter from pdf to html and eventually other formats (text and MSWord).  The UI is based on a Django-backed app built on [jQuery-File-Upload](http://aquantum-demo.appspot.com/file-upload). That JQuery app was developed by Sebastian Tschan, with the source available on [github](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload). This was [ported to Django](https://github.com/sigurdga/django-jquery-file-upload) by Sigurd Gartmann ([sigurdga on github](https://github.com/sigurdga/)).

Ari Hershowitz has connected it to a pdf converter, based on the server. For a Django app to use JQuery-File-Upload, you should branch from [here](https://github.com/sigurda/django-jquery-file-upload).
